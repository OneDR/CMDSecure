# CMDSecure

Even though it is simple to just excecute the commands needed to do the same function they are complecated and hard to access. By installing CMDSecure on your server or computer you have a quick access to all the finormation you need for no cost at all. 

# How Does it Work?

CMDSecure will scan the SSH ports on your computer and will let you know if anyone is connected via one of them. If someone is indeed connected then CMDSecure will provide you with the User they are long on with and will also provide you with their IP address. Finally it will give you the option to disconnect them.
