# Mercury

Mercury is a program that you can install on your computer or server and will let you know who is connected as well as give you their information and allow you to disconnect them. Even though it is simple to just execute the commands needed to do the same function they are complicated and hard to access. By installing Mercury on your server or computer you have a quick access to all the information you need for no cost at all. 

# How Does it Work?

Mercury will scan the SSH ports on your computer and will let you know if anyone is connected via one of them. If someone is indeed connected then Mercury will provide you with the User they are long on with and will also provide you with their IP address. Finally it will give you the option to disconnect them.
